Tis is a small test sketch for the M5Stack Base "Node".

The Demo contains:
- FastLED (https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) to drive the leds on the Base
- Some code pieces from https://github.com/m5stack/Bases-Node
- Infrared Library by crankygoldit https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266

Unfortunately i do not get the WM8978 to work yet - maybe somebody can help
